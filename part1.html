        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                After World War 2 and China's war against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army took control of China and formed the People's Republic of China.
                The process of conquering China happened in three sections.

                        The nationalists and communists each tried to take back as much of the previously 
                        Japanese-controlled land during the war as possible. They mainly focused on trying to make peace between eachother.

                        Nationalists took more control and land and were more successful than the communists.

                        Communists gained more victories, took control of mainland China and formed the People's Republic of China.

        <h2>
            Beginning of the Civil War
        </h2>
            <p>
                The communist armies, led by Zhu De, immediately started rushing to take Japanese-controlled territory upon learning that Japan 
                would soon surrender. Despite Chiang Kai-Shek's order to stay put, Zhu ordered his troops to start taking the land on August 11, 
                4 days before Japan officially surrendered.
                <br></br>
                The United States assisted the Chinese in their fight against Japan, sending 53,000 marines to Tianjin and Qingdao and 
                moving Chinese troops around. However, as the communist forces were communist, the US ordered the Japanese only to surrender 
                their equipment to the Nationalist armies upon Japan's surrender.
                <br></br>
                At first, the communists and nationalists had meetings to discuss possible peaceful solutions, like one on October 10, 
                1942, where they agreed on a plan for a new government. After that, however, they had difficulties agreeing on the leadership 
                and administration of the new government. They were closest to reaching a solid agreement in 1946, but soon afterward, it became 
                apparent that the agreement would not pan out.
