        <h1>Turning Point: The Cultural Revolution</h1>
        <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>
                Mao's apprehension of the USSR's new leadership and policies and other factors led to high tension between China 
                and the USSR. By the early 1960s, the tension was so high that Mao devised a plan that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Phase out any government officials that didn't share Mao's beliefs about how China's government.</li>
                <li>Influence the youth to make them more revolutionary</li>
                <li>Make healthcare, education, etc. less "elitist"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                His plan for doing all of this focused primarily on the nation's children through a program called the "Red Guards."
            </p>

                Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution in May 1966, closing down the schools and influencing the Chinese people
                 (mostly the children) through media to rebel against their leadership. Under the belief that "political 
                 power grows out of the barrel of a gun," an expression constructed and pushed by Mao, many elders and educated 
                 people/scholars/intellectuals were physically and mentally abused or killed. The destruction and terror among the 
                 general population harmed the economy and caused industrial production to go down 12% from 1966 to 1968.
