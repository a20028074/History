                Mao's apprehension of the USSR's new leadership and policies and other factors led to high tension between China 
                and the USSR. By the early 1960s, the tension was so high that Mao devised a plan that would:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Phase out any government officials that didn't share Mao's beliefs about how China's government.</li>
                <li>Influence the youth to make them more revolutionary</li>
                <li>Make healthcare, education, etc. less "elitist"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                His plan for doing all of this focused primarily on the nation's children through a program called the "Red Guards."
